# Project: Etch-a-Sketch

I’m excited to take on the Etch-a-Sketch project as a way to strengthen my Css styling and DOM manipulation skills. This project is all about creating a browser-based sketchpad that captures the essence of the classic toy.

This project will be challenging, but that’s what makes it so rewarding. It’s an opportunity to apply what I’ve learned and to explore new JavaScript methods and CSS properties.

## Project Objectives

By working on this project, I want to:

1. **To enhance my DOM Manipulation Skills:** Dynamically update the DOM based on user interactions.
2. **To practice Event Handling:** Use event listeners to capture and respond to user actions like mouse movements and clicks.
3. **To develop Creative Problem-Solving:** Overcome challenges like creating a grid layout, managing drawing functionality, and adding customizable features.
4. **To explore Advanced CSS Styling:** Make the sketchpad visually appealing and easy to use.
5. **To foster Independent Learning:** Dive into resources and documentation to learn new techniques beyond the course material.

## My Strategy

- I plan to break the project into smaller tasks and focus on completing them one at a time.
- I’ll use browser developer tools to debug and test styles and JavaScript functionality.
- My priority will be getting the functionality right before refining the design for aesthetics.
